WhispList Mission & Promise
===========================

**Emotional Purpose**
WhispList exists so people can privately share their hopes, fears and confessions without judgement. Every wish is treated with empathy so users feel lighter and more connected after posting.

**Safety Philosophy**
We keep identity optional, never selling personal data. Public wishes are read-only for everyone but can be removed if reported or hidden by the author. Gift payments are processed securely through trusted services.

**User Promise**
Your words belong to you. You may delete your posts and export your data anytime. We only store the minimum info needed to deliver boosts, gifts and notifications.
