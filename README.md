# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file and add your Firebase and Google credentials

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # then edit .env and fill in the values
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Poll Mode

Wishes can optionally include a poll with two text choices. Enable **Poll Mode** on the home screen to add options A and B when posting a wish. Vote results update in real time on the wish detail screen.

## Push notifications

The app registers a device for Expo push notifications. A Firebase Cloud
Function in `functions/index.js` listens for Firestore updates and sends a
notification whenever a wish gets a new like or comment. The push token saved
with each wish is used so the creator receives the message automatically.
