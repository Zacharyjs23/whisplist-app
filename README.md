# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file and add your Firebase and Google credentials

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # then edit .env and fill in the values
   ```

   The app requires the following Firebase environment variables:

   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`

   Missing values will disable Firebase features at runtime.

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Keep your branch up to date

To minimize merge conflicts, rebase your work on top of the latest `main` branch before pushing:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

This rewrites your local commits onto the updated history, avoiding merge commits and keeping the project history linear.

## Poll Mode

Wishes can optionally include a poll with two text choices. Enable **Poll Mode** on the home screen to add options A and B when posting a wish. Vote results update in real time on the wish detail screen.

## Legal

New users must accept our [Terms of Service](TERMS.md) and [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) during onboarding.

## Audio support

`expo-av` has been deprecated in favor of the new [`expo-audio`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/audio/) library.
When you upgrade, replace `expo-av` imports with `expo-audio` and adjust any API
changes (mainly how sound and recording objects are created). The rest of the
logic in this repo can remain largely the same.

## Push notifications

The app registers the device for Expo push notifications on first launch.
A Firebase Cloud Function in `functions/index.js` listens for Firestore
updates and sends a notification whenever a wish gets a new like, comment,
or a reply to a comment. Each user's Expo push token is stored in their
profile document so the appropriate user receives the message automatically.

## Troubleshooting TypeScript errors

If your editor reports missing modules such as `react-native` or `expo-router`, ensure you:

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Open the project root (`whisplist-app`) in your IDE so it picks up `tsconfig.json`.
3. The alias `@/` points to the repository root. Your editor should respect this alias after reading `tsconfig.json`.

## Troubleshooting iOS build errors

If `expo run:ios` fails with errors like `Redefinition of module 'ReactCommon'` or
`Could not build module 'DarwinFoundation'`, clean the pods and reinstall them
before trying again:

```bash
./scripts/clean-ios-pods.sh
npx expo run:ios
```

The script removes the `Pods` directory, clears Xcode's derived data, and runs
`pod install --repo-update` so the iOS project builds from a clean state.

## SVG assets

You can import SVGs as React components thanks to `react-native-svg` and the
configured Metro transformer. Example:

```tsx
import Logo from '@/assets/images/react-logo.svg';

export function HeaderLogo() {
  return <Logo width={120} height={40} />;
}
```

If TypeScript complains, ensure your editor is picking up `types/svg.d.ts`.

## Firestore rules tests locally

Rules tests are skipped unless a local emulator is running. Start your emulator
on port 8080 (e.g. `firebase emulators:start`) and run:

```bash
npm run test:rules:emu
```

## Storage/Firestore emulator tests

You can run both Firestore and Storage rules suites against local emulators.

1) Ensure emulators are running (default ports shown):

- Firestore: `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:8080`
- Storage: `FIREBASE_STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:9199`

2) Run the rules tests:

```
FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:8080 \
FIREBASE_STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:9199 \
npm run test:rules
```

Suites are under `tests/rules/*` and include Firestore (wishes, dmThreads, users, gifts)
and Storage (type/size limits, ownership, DM media access, public read buckets).
